Before I got to my last master the RPM was no longer available, and the scaleup playbook failed. I became aware that 3.3.11 is not compatible and should not have been made available.
Unfortunately all members of my etcd cluster were already upgraded and the fix is to take down the cluster, downgrade etcd, and restore from snapshot.</description></item><item><title>Migration of Etcd to Masters for OpenShift 3.9 to 3.10 Upgrade</title><link>https://dwnwrd.github.io/blog/2019/02/08/Migration-of-Etcd-to-Masters-for-OpenShift-3.9-Upgrade-to-3.10/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwnwrd.github.io/blog/2019/02/08/Migration-of-Etcd-to-Masters-for-OpenShift-3.9-Upgrade-to-3.10/</guid><description>As of OpenShift Container Platform 3.10 etcd is expected to run in static pods on the master nodes in the control plane. You may have a deployed an HA cluster with dedicated etcd nodes managed with systemd. How do you migrate the this new architecture?
Assumptions:
You are running OCP 3.9 You have multiple Master nodes You have dedicated Etcd nodes You are running RHEL, not Atomic nodes Outline:</description></item></channel></rss>
